    1. Waiter service

    Benefits

    Service is more personalized as you serve diners directly.
    You can accommodate special requests more easily compared to other services.

    More prone to mistakes as miscommunication with the kitchen can lead to wrong orders being served to guests.


    2. Chinese banquet service
    This is another form of waiter service where each waiter takes care of a table or group of tables with 10-12 guests. Dishes are usually communal and shared.

    Station-type buffet – Waiters serve the beverages while guests get the other dishes from the buffet line.
    Modified deluxe buffet – Tables are set with cutlery; waiters serve the beverages, coffee, and dessert while guests get the other dishes from the buffet line.
    Deluxe buffet – Waiters serve appetizers, soup and/or salads, and beverages. Guests take the other dishes from the buffet line.
    Benefits

    Buffet tables are easy to prepare.
    Waiters focus only on serving a few dishes and clearing tables.
    Challenges

    Last-minute special requests can be challenging because of time and resource constraints.
    This service can make diners feel alienated as waiters only clear plates and have little interaction with them.
    4. Self-service
    In this type of food service, diners place, pay, and pick up their orders at a counter similar to fast casual and fast-food establishments.

    Benefits

    Waiters only need to stay behind the station counter to take orders.
    Waiters do not have to go around the restaurant as the food is self-serviced.
    Challenges

    Diners expect quick service, so you must prepare or pre-prepare promptly.
    Rush hours can be tiring and stressful because there may be queues.
    5. Semi-self service
    Similar to self-service, this type of service requires diners to order and pay for their orders at the counter but waiters serve the food when ready.

    Benefits

    Waiters only need to stay at the counter to take orders and receive payment.
    Services have an easier time delivering orders because a number system identifies diners.
    Challenges

    You must prepare food promptly since customers expect quick service.
    Rush hours can be tiring and even more challenging when a long line forms and guests expect speedy service.

    Different types of service for your restaurant
    With all the different types of service available, finding the right one for your restaurant can create a more enjoyable experience for your diners. Here are 4 common types of restaurants and the types of matching services:

    High-end restaurant – Waiter service
    Casual dining restaurant – Waiter service/semi-self-service/self-service
    Fast food – Self-service/semi-self service
    Café – Self-service
    Some establishments also combine two types of service in their restaurant. Some businesses have a buffet service, but also offer a waiter service for guests who opt to choose from an a la carte menu. Have you decided on how you will establish your food service already? Choosing among the types of service is all up to you but make sure it fits the needs of your target market as well.
